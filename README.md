# Deformed Convolution
This repo was made with the intention of testing deformed convolution in comparison to a normal convolutional layers

You can read the deform convolution paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06211.pdf)

NOTE: The forward pass of a deformed conv is slower than a regular one
